# Welcome to your ZMA Notes!

- This is your first note
- 
- All notes are markdown
    - Use bullets for all text

## Getting Started
- You can create a new note by creating a link like this [[My New Note]].
    - Then use go to definiton to create the corresponding file
- Make sure you configure vscode autocomplete which will transform things like writing today to [[2025-06-28]].
- Always start your day by running `ZMA: Today` to create your daily note.
- You can link to external resources with regular markdown links [Google](https://www.google.com)
    - ZMA will shorten the links when you reindex (`ZMA: Reindex`) to make them easier to read.
- You can create your TODOs by starting a bullet with TODO.
    - TODO Try out creating a new task
    - Complete the task by changing TODO to DONE
- You can also highlight THOUGHT and QUESTION in the same way.
- #hashtags also work
- Make sure to checkout the backlink and task explorer in the sidebar!

Enjoy organizing your thoughts!
